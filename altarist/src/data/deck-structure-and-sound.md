# ðŸ”Š Deck-Based Component Structure & Sound Design

## Component Organization by Deck
- Components should be organized by deck structure.
- Each deck can share animation and style foundations, supporting scalability and easier prototyping.
- New cards will be added and released by deck, making it easy to expand the app.

## Sound as a Core Feature
- **Deck Signature Sound:** Each deck will have its own signature background sound and style, reinforcing its theme and mood.
- **Card Foley/Specific Sounds:** Each card can trigger unique sound effects or foley, enhancing immersion and feedback.
- **Scalable Audio System:** Consider a modular audio manager or context to handle playback, volume, and transitions between deck and card sounds.

## Benefits
- Modularity and thematic consistency
- Easier prototyping and release workflow
- Future expansion is straightforward
- Supports immersive, audio-driven experiences
